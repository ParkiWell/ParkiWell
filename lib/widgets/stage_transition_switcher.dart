/// the trailing edge — the two never overlap, so old content can't ghost
/// under the new. The host must paint a continuous backdrop behind this
/// switcher (both stages briefly reveal it mid-transition). Set [reverse]
/// before switching [child] when navigating back so the motion mirrors.
/// Stages are told apart by their keys, so each stage must carry a unique
